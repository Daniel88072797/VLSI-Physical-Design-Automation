## Physical Design Automation

### Homework 1: P&R Tool
Utilizing a P&R tool (Cadence Innovus) to do APR to generate a layout.
Goal：Optimizing timing, total area of chip, and total wire length without violating any timing or DRC constraints.
### Homework 2: Two-way Min-cut Partitioning
Let 𝑪 be a set of cells and 𝑵 be a set of nets. Each net connects a subset of cells. The two-way min-cut partitioning problem is to partition the cell set into two disjoint groups 𝑨 and 𝑩, where each group of cells is put in a different die. The 
cost of a two-way partitioning is measured by the cut size, which is the number of nets having cells in both groups.
